    <abstract>
           <t>This document defines a method to receive accepted and rejected NLRI
            over a BGP peering session.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
    BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> operators face challenges when attempting
    to troubleshoot external BGP sessions.  Commonly operators debug BGP sessions
    with commands that display the results of advertised or received routes.
</t>

<t>
    When operating a network, you can easily verify you are sending routes to a
    BGP peer, but you have limited ability to understand the external partner
    device.  Common debugging tools such as a looking glass or contacting a
    remote operator via e-mail, telephone or other out of band methods is required.
</t>

<t>
    This proposal intends to provide an automated method to see the NLRI
    eligible for selection that pass any filtering methods provided by the
    peer software stack.
